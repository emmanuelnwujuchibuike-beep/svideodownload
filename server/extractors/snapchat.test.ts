/**
 * Snapchat Spotlight watermark removal.
 *
 * Spotlight share pages serve a watermarked render (the `.27.` rendition, and a
 * `mo` query carrying `SpotlightSharing`); the same media is served clean at the
 * `.1034.` story-original rendition. The bug this suite pins: the rewrite only
 * matched a `/d/` media path, while Spotlight also serves from `/y/` — so a
 * `/y/` URL passed the watermark check and had nothing rewritten, and the file
 * downloaded WITH the watermark. That is the reported "Snapchat Spotlight still
 * downloads with watermarks".
